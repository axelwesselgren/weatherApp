= Weather App

Weather App is a custom Java Swing application using SMHI API to display a 10 day weather forecast based on the given location (IP).

It uses ipify.org API and ipinfo.io in order to first get the public IP of the user and then the GEO location (lat, lon) based of the given IP. 

The latitude and longitud is then used in the SMHI API URL to retrieve a 10 day weather forecast based on the given GEO location.
